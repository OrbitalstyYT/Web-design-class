          <p>Minecraft<br><b>Minecraft is a sandbox video game that allows players to explore, create, and survive in a blocky, procedurally generated 3D world. Developed by Mojang Studios (acquired by Microsoft in 2014), it was originally created by Markus Persson and officially released in 2011.

            Key Features:
            Block-Based World: Everything in Minecraft is made of blocks—cubes representing materials like dirt, stone, wood, and ores. Players can mine (break) and place these blocks to build anything they imagine.
            
            Game Modes:
            
            Survival Mode: Players gather resources, manage hunger, and fend off monsters while trying to survive.
            
            Creative Mode: Players have unlimited resources and can fly, making it perfect for building and experimenting.
            
            Adventure Mode: Designed for custom maps and stories, where players interact with objects but have limited building abilities.
            
            Hardcore Mode: A variation of Survival with a higher difficulty and permanent death.
            
            Multiplayer: Players can join servers to collaborate or compete with others, often participating in mini-games, custom worlds, or large-scale builds.
            
            Redstone & Commands: Advanced players use redstone (Minecraft’s version of electrical wiring) and command blocks to create complex machines, automated systems, or even entire games within the game.
            
            Expansive Community: Minecraft has a huge modding community, content creators, and educators using it as a tool for teaching programming, architecture, and problem-solving.
            
            Cultural Impact:
            Minecraft is one of the best-selling video games of all time and has become a cultural phenomenon, influencing everything from education to pop culture. Its simplicity, creativity, and openness make it accessible to players of all ages.</b></p>
